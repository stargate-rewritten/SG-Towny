# Description
Stargate and towny are jointly among the oldest continuously developed MC plugins.
Historically, they have been closely integrated -- stargates are an ideal addition to towny's mechanics!

Unfortuantely, stargate's development stagnated over time, and with it, so has stargate's relationship with towny.
This addon aims to help with that.

#### Features:
- [To be determined](https://github.com/stargate-rewritten/SG-Towny/issues)
- Virtual bank support.
- Town and nation networks, as well as pre-made portalsmith towny permission group.
- Compatibility with towny plot switch perms
- A new "terminal" plot type for `T`  gate integration.
